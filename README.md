### Running the app during development

You can pick one of these options:

* install node.js and run `node server.js`

Then navigate your browser to `http://localhost:<port>` to see the app running in
your browser.


### Running the app in production


### Running unit tests


### End to end testing

Angular ships with a baked-in end-to-end test runner that understands angular, your app and allows
you to write your tests with jasmine-like BDD syntax.

Requires a webserver, node.js + `server.js` or your backend server that hosts the angular static files.

Check out the
[end-to-end runner's documentation](http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/dev_guide.e2e-testing) for more
info.
